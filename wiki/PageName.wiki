Miniemc2 it's port of well know EMC2 CNC controller to embedded device. It allow you to control your CNC machine without PC via Ethernet or WI-FI (in the future). Miniemc2 provides STEP and DIRECTION signals to control stepper motors. Main features: 
 * Up to 6 axis ( should be clarified during tests )
 * Step frequency up to 40 kHz
 * STEP's width and polarity fixed: 10 uS, rising
 * 19 digital inputs, 19 digital outputs. Each of them can be inverted.
 * Each output can be assigned to STEP/DIR/PWM or Digital Output ( controlled from NC program)
 * Each input can be assigned to axes Home or Limit switch, or to E-STOP button
 * 2 PWM channels with fixed frequency (1 kHz) and 100 values of duty cycle
 * NC program execution from USB Flash or SD card
 * FTP access for data uploading
 * Control over network with TkEMC
 * Original WEB interface instead of TkEMC
 * External control panel can be connected via Digital Inputs ( with _halui_ )
