#summary miniEMC2 preliminary manual.

= Introduction =
Miniemc2 it's port of well known EMC2 CNC controller to embedded device. It allows you to control your CNC machine without PC via Ethernet or WI-FI (in the future). Miniemc2 provides STEP and DIRECTION signals to control stepper motors. Main features: 
 * Up to 6 axis ( should be clarified during tests )
 * Step frequency up to 40 kHz
 * STEP's width and polarity fixed: 10 uS, rising
 * 19 digital inputs, 19 digital outputs. Each of them can be inverted.
 * Each output can be assigned to STEP/DIR/PWM or Digital Output ( controlled from NC program)
 * Each input can be assigned to axes Home or Limit switch, or to E-STOP button
 * 2 PWM channels with fixed frequency (1 kHz) and 100 values of duty cycle
 * NC program execution from USB Flash or SD card
 * FTP access for data uploading
 * Control over network with TkEMC
 * Original WEB interface instead of TkEMC
 * External control panel can be connected via Digital Inputs ( with _halui_ )

= Difference from original EMC2 =
As a base for miniEMC2 was selected version 2.2.0. Later was added changes from v 2.2.8, so this is almost EMC2-2.2.8. Due to S3C2440 CPU limitation was added some changes to HAL. First of all Xenomai real-time development framework is used instead of RTAI. There is no special abstraction for Xenomai, just added some changes to sim RTAPI abstraction in such way, that instead of _libpth_ used Xenomai's native API. Second diffrence is how hard realtime parts implemented. All standart HW drivers, like _partport_ and _stepgen_ was discarded due to their performance. Hard realtime functions, based on FIQ interrupt from periodic timer with 10 uS period, was used instead. This patch was taken from OpenMoko projects.  More details will be provided in the last part on this doc. At present time just one important note. _There is dedicated coordinate FIFO between motion controller and FIQ frequency synthesizer. That is we always have some delays between commanded and actual position. This delay can be calculated as N*1mS, N is FIFO deep. By default FIFO deep is 32, so delay is 32 mS. User can vary this value from 8 to 32.
FIFO's delay adds some restrictions of usage of this port, please note this._
Interaction between _FIQ_ and _motion controller_ provided by dedicated HAL driver named *modminiemc*. It implements almost all functions of _parport_ and _stepgen_ components. All other HW drivers are absent at present time, but HAL components, like logical primitives, regulators, i.ะต. HW-independent parts, are avaliable to user.  miniEMC2 don't use mini2440's display due to low performance of GUI together with EMC2, only remote control is possible. User can choise between remote control by TkEMC and dedicated WEB-based GUI. Number of simultaneously working axis is open question. FIQ frequency synthesizer supports up to 6 channels, but author not sure if CPU has enough performance. 4 channels forks fine, if you would like more - try and share results.
And the latest: _only trivial kinematics are working fine_, non-trivial ones also present, but they don't work due to CPU's perfomance. If you have read this chapter careful and you still interested in this project - go ahead with quick start in the next chapter.
= Quick start =

Software binary package consits tree parts: u-boot boot loader, Linux kernel image and root filesystem image (and its tarbal). Before start you need to dowload the latest firmware archive from _Download_ section of this site and untar it. Of course you need _mini2440_ evalution board without display. You need to connect it to PC with RS-232 cable and Ethernet cable. Will be good to have inseted SD card for NC program storing.

From PC side you have to install serial communication util, like PuTTY and TFTP server, for example TFTP32 for Windows or any other. Your PC should be connected to the same Ethernet network as the _mini2440_.

First you need to install u-boot bootloader. I just point you to page with detailed description of  [http://www.google.com/url?url=http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/Mini2440%23Flashing_uboot&rct=j&q=mini2440+u-boot+setup&usg=AFQjCNGKmz5THZr0yw7V5xiD08asalhM6Q&sa=X&ei=XOK2Tp2EIuP34QTalqnJBQ&ved=0CCYQygQwAQ&cad=rja setup process]. Binary image of u-boot provided by me is almost the same as in that one at my link except some additional environment varibles I've added. So if you have already flashed u-boot, then you can just set next variables:
<code>
set update_kernel 'tftpboot 0x32000000 uImage; nand erase 0x60000 0x500000; nand write.e 0x32000000 0x60000 0x500000'
set update_fs 'tftpboot 0x32000000 rootfs.jffs2; nand erase 0x560000 0x2000000; nand write.e 0x32000000 0x560000 ${filesize}'
set bootargs 'bootargs=console=ttySAC0,115200n8 root=/dev/mtdblock3 rootfstype=jffs2'
set bootcmd 'nand read.e 0x32000000 0x60000 0x500000; bootm 0x32000000'
set update 'run update_kernel;run update_fs;run bootcmd'
saveenv
</code>
